# MIT-6.828

This is the Operating System Engineering course (6.828) offerd by MIT in 2018 Fall. 

The course website is here: https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/

I am trying to keep up with the schedule just like a normal MIT student who is taking this class, even though I won't be able to attend lectures. 
However, I did find some recorded lectures [here](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2011/schedule.html). 
Apparently they are recorded by a student who was taking the course using a mobile phone in 2011 so you can imagine the quality of those videos and since the 2011 version of this course is somewhat different than the 2018 version, the lectures don't really match exactly.

My goal is to not only finish those labs but to be able to write out a full write-up for every exercise and hopefully as much challenges exercises as possible.
I guess I will see how my normal school schedule goes :)
